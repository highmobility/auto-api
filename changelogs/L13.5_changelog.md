# AutoAPI L13 Extensions #5 Changelog

**Level 13** _5th extension_ (aka **L13.5**) mainly includes additive updates to the protocol. A significant number of new dashboard lights have been added, necessitating a minor change to the custom type.

## Dashboard Lights

**New** dashboard lights have been added to the `dashboard_light` custom type.

To accommodate the number of new values, the custom type size has changed from 2 bytes to 3 bytes to increase the number of possible values for the enum.

More specifically, the size of item (enum) `name` inside the `dashboard_light`-type has been increased to 2 bytes.

For example:
```
- id: 0x49
  name: 'lighting_system_failure`
```

Will become:
```
- id: 0x0049
  name: 'lighting_system_failure`
```

And the whole type would look like this when serialized:
```
- data_component: '004900'
  values:
    name: 'lighting_system_failure'
    state: 'off'
```
