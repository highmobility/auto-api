# AutoAPI L13 Extensions #6 Changelog

**Level 13** _6th extension_ (aka **L13.6**) contains mostly additive updates to the protocol.
These include new properties for existing capabilities, additions to already existing enums, and new custom types.
One property has been deprecated and renamed to harmonize with similar properties.

Changes from L13.5 are divided into these sub-sections:

* [Enums](#enums)
* [Properties](#properties)
* [Custom Types](#custom-types)


## Enums

Some enums have gained new values.

- `charging.current_type` (added `wireless`)
- `charging.station_status` (added `initialising`, `fault`, `inactive`)
- `dashboard_lights.dashboard_lights` (added `high_beam_left_failure`, `high_beam_right_failure`, `daytime_running_light_left_failure`, `daytime_running_light_right_failure`, `side_mark_lights_failure`, `licence_plate_light_failure`)

There are also a few new units added to existing unit types:

- `unit.energy_efficiency`
	- `kilometers_per_kwh`
	- `miles_per_gallon_equivalent`
	- `miles_per_imperial_gallon_equivalent`

- `unit.fuel_efficiency`
	- `kilometers_per_liter`


## Properties

New properties added to pre-existing capabilities:

- _charging_
	- `distance_since_charging`

- _maintenance_
  - `service_warning`
	- `last_service_date`
	- `last_service_distance`
	- `next_inspection_distance`

- _trips_
	- `average_electric_consumption`

- _usage_
	- `average_speed_since_charging`
	- `energy_consumption_last_trip`
	- `energy_consumption_since_reset`
	- `energy_consumption_since_charging`
	- `energy_consumption_percentages_last_trip`
	- `energy_consumption_percentages_since_reset`
	- `energy_consumption_percentages_since_charging`
	- `fuel_consumption_rate_since_start`

Existing properties that were deprecated:

- _usage_
	- `fuel_consumption_rate_last_trip` (renamed to `fuel_consumption_rate_since_start`)

## Custom Types

New custom types added.

- `energy_consumption`
- `energy_consumption_percentage`
- `service_warning`
