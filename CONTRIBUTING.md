## Introduction

We would love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. Before getting to work, please first discuss the changes that you wish to make with us via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/highmobility/hmkit-swift/issues), [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/high-mobility/) or [Slack](https://slack.high-mobility.com/).


## Pull Request Process

We strive to ensure high quality across all our projects. In order to achieve this, we require that *all* pull requests are *covered by tests* and are there to improve the SDK for everyone, not just a single narrow use-case.


## Code Review Process

Code review takes place in GitHub pull requests. See [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you're not familiar with GitHub Pull Requests.  

Once you open a pull request, project maintainers will review your code and respond to your pull request with any feedback they might have. The process at this point is as follows: 

- Thumbs-up are required from project maintainers
- Your change will be merged into the project's master branch


## How to report a bug

Any security issues should be submitted directly to [security@high-mobility.com](mailto:security@high-mobility.com). In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:  

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions is "yes" then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [security@high-mobility.com](mailto:security@high-mobility.com).

 
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:  

- What version of the library are you using?
- What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead? 

General questions should go to [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/high-mobility) instead of the issue tracker.
